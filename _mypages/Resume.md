## Summary

Thanks to my analytical mindset and a good dose of common sense, I can quickly drill down to the essence of software and its role in a business. Using my engineering skills, I turn these insights into maintainable software. Teamwork preferred!

## Employment

* Software Engineer at [Ortec](https://ortec.com/) (since 2015)
  * Maintenance and development of new features for Ortec's flagship product, Routing and Dispatch. This is a very large Delphi and C# codebase, with occasionally some C, C++ or Python. Of course, this also involves quite some work with SQL (MS SQLServer).
  * Development of new features for COMETS, which is a small C# WPF software package for use by non-profits giving healthcare in Africa. It is mainly used for patient administration.
  * Maintenance and administration of the Continuous Integration platform that is used by the whole software development department of Ortec. This is currently a homebrew Python system, but I will replace it by a Jenkins (Java) solution.
* Software Developer / Researcher at [Almende](http://www.almende.org) and [DoBots](http://www.dobots.nl) (2012 - 2014)
  * Lead development on the Almende part of the European FP7 project ARUM, which included developing JBoss ESB services, a NodeJS agent system and front-end JS development, as well as coordination with the other ARUM partners.
  * Business and technical development for the robotics startup DoBots, which is an Almende spin-off. This involved identifying business opportunities and creating prototypes, often including Android (Java) development and embedded software in C and C++.

## Formal Education

* Master degree Cognitive Neuroscience at Radboud University Nijmegen, cum laude (2010 - 2012). During this master I focused on computational neuroscience (eg simulation of neural networks) and machine learning (eg computer vision, optimization and neural networks for classification). This meant a large part of my master was spent programming, mainly in C++ and MATLAB. I wrote some of that code for parallel and distributed systems, for the performance benefits.
* Bachelor degree Theoretical Physics at Radboud University Nijmegen, cum laude (2006 - 2010). During my bachelors I not only learned to program in C and C++, but also spent time on extracurricular activities such as organizing a study trip and attending honours courses.
