## This Website

Welcome to my personal website! You'll find some tidbits about me, and some code and ideas of which I think at least a couple of people are interested in them.

This website is hosted by Github. The source can also be found there, under a MIT license. The design is based on the Flex theme for Jekyll, which was created by Jeff Martin.

## Me

I am a scientist by training and a software engineer by profession. Some of my lifelong interests are machine learning and AI, robotics, and engineering in general.
