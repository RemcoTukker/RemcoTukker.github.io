## This Website

Welcome to my personal website! You'll find some tidbits about me, and some code and ideas of which I think at least a couple of people are interested in them.

This website uses the site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted by Github. The source can also be found [there](https://github.com/RemcoTukker/RemcoTukker.github.io), under a MIT license. The design is based on a Jekyll theme that was created by Jeff Martin, [Flex](https://github.com/the-development/flex).

## Me

I am a scientist by training and a software engineer by profession. Some of my lifelong interests are machine learning and AI, robotics, and engineering in general; I love working on the cutting edge of science and technology. Also check out my [Resume](/Resume/).
