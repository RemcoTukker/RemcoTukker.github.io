Some interesting links, especially for myself!

## Physics

Thermodynamics

* [John E.J. Schmitz](https://secondlawoflife.wordpress.com/) Blog by a chemist that wrote a book about the second law of TD.
* [Peter Reimann: Brownian motors: noisy transport far from equilibrium, 2001](http://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0010237.pdf) Must-read report reviewing all essential work on ratchets.
* [Hmolpedia: Encyclopedia of Human Thermodynamics, Human Chemistry, and Human Physics](http://www.eoht.info/) Ok, only tangentially relevant, but such a nice website that I had to include a link somewhere ;-)
* [Geller Labs](http://www.gellerlabs.com/JCan%20Parts%20and%20Kits.htm) DIY circuit for measuring Johnson noise.

Experiments

* [Robert Murray Smith](https://www.youtube.com/user/RobertMurraySmith) Chemist that has a lot of videos showing you precisely how to make photoactive materials, graphene, batteries, etc.
* [Nyle Steiner](http://www.sparkbangbuzz.com/) Mainly electronics related experiments, such as homemade tunnel diodes, memristors and lots of other components. Also has links to more science projects websites at the bottom of his website.
* [Laserhacker](http://laserhacker.com) Interesting electronics stuff.

## Operations Research

* [Michael Marte: Models And Algorithms For School Timetabling - A Constraint Programming Approach, 5 July 2002](http://www.en.pms.ifi.lmu.de/publications/dissertationen/PMS-DISS-2003-1/PMS-DISS-2003-1.pdf)
* [Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling 2014 Proceedings](http://www.patatconference.org/patat2014/proceedings.html) Papers describing the state of the art in timetabling.
* [The Design of Approximation Algorithms](http://www.designofapproxalgs.com/book.pdf) A whole book, written very recently in 2010 / 2011, about approximation algorithms and their design. Extremely useful and well-written as well. Scheduling is not investigated too much, mainly because scheduling can so far only be approximated in some very specific cases.
* [DMOZ list of scheduling utilities](http://www.dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Educational/Administration_and_School_Management/Scheduling_Utilities/)

A couple of open source scheduling programs that include automatic scheduling:

* [FET](http://lalescu.ro/liviu/fet/) GPL licensed scheduling software for schools that claims to schedule anything within 6k teachers and 30k student groups within 20 minutes.
* [UniTime](http://www.unitime.org) GPL licensed scheduling software based on a Phd thesis that describes the constraint solver, which is supposedly very powerful.
* [Tablix](http://www.tablix.org) GPL licensed scheduling software using a genetic algorithm.

A couple of apparently better known commercial scheduling programs for schools that include automatic scheduling:

* [ascTimeTables](http://www.asctimetables.com) 400 euro and upwards. Only doing schedules for education. Looks quite modern.
* [PrimeTable](http://www.primetimetable.com) 250 euro per year and upwards. Only doing schedules for education. Works on phones/tablets (who would want that??).
* [MIMOSA](http://www.mimosasoftware.com/) 500 euro and upwards for larger schools / add-ons, etc. Only doing scheduling for education.
* [REDIKER](http://www.rediker.com/scheduling_plus.html) unknown price, company focuses on school administration, should have good integration with their own products at least (?).
* [UNTIS](http://www.grupet.at/home_en.php) unknown price, only doing scheduling for education.
* [EMS Campus](http://www.dea.com/ProductsAndServices/Campus/Default.aspx?mi=3) unknown price, doing scheduling for all kinds of organization (not manufacturing though).

* [Self Stabilizing Prothese](http://www.imdi-sprint.nl/huidige-projecten/een-nieuwe-beenprothese-ter-verbetering-van-de-zijwaartse-balans-van-protheselopers/) Foot prothese for humans that has some mechanical system for lateral stabilization; might be interesting for robots too!

## Artificial Intelligence

* [Vicarious](http://vicarious.com/) Company started by a cofounder of Numenta. (By the way, some interview with Jeff Hawkins suggested they didn't part on friendly terms, but who cares..)
* [Algorithms, games, and evolution](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/29/10620.abstract) Recent article making a link between game theory and evolution, trying to explain the role of sex and maintainance of variation
